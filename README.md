# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to act as HR analyst for Pewlett Hackard and conduct employee research using SQL to determine which employees are expected to retire in the upcoming years, and how many positions will they need to fill. The purpose of the challenge was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

When looking at the list of retirees and what title they hold:
- There seems to be some employees inputed twice because they had help two different positions while at Pewlett Hackard. The second image is the cleaned data, where the duplicates were removed.
- The second image, where the data has been rid of duplicates shows us the  correct number of employes: 90,398.
- Looking at the third image we can see that Senior Engineers have the most retirees, compared to Managers which only have 2.
- The third image helps Pewlett Hackard learn which positions will need to be filled in the coming years.


### Deliverable 2: Indentifying Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

- This table allows Pewlett Hackard to determine who is eligible for a mentorship program
- From this we know that there are 1,549 employees eligible for the program.
- This information allows for the company to better prepare for the "silver tsunami" and lessen potential negative outcomes
- The number of employees eligible for the program is a lot smaller than those who are up for retirement.


## Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Pewlett Hackard could potentially have over 90,000 roles that need to be filled in order to keep the company operating smoothly. However, there are only around 1500 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This poses as a problem for Pewlett Hackard.
